‚Ä¢  module.exports
This defines what this file will export when it‚Äôs required/imported in another part of the application.
‚Ä¢  ServerConfig: require('./server-config')
Imports (requires) the file server-config.js from the same directory and assigns it to the property ServerConfig.
‚Ä¢  Logger: require('./logger-config')
Imports logger-config.js and assigns it to the Logger property.
‚Ä¢  Queue: require('./queue-config')
Imports queue-config.js and assigns it to the Queue property.
 Code Review & Explanation
‚Ä¢	createLogger ‚Üí function used to create a new Winston logger instance.
‚Ä¢	format ‚Üí collection of formatting utilities (like timestamp, printf, etc.).
‚Ä¢	transports ‚Üí defines where logs are sent (e.g., console, file, HTTP, database, etc.).
 Custom Format
‚Ä¢	printf ‚Üí allows you to define your own log message format.
‚Ä¢	The format here outputs logs like:
‚Ä¢	2025-10-21 09:14:03 : info: Server started successfully
‚Ä¢	2025-10-21 09:14:10 : error: Database connection failed
‚Ä¢	error is included in the destructure but not used ‚Äî you could remove it or enhance the format to show error details if needed.
 Logger Configuration
What this does:
‚Ä¢	Combines the timestamp and your customFormat.
‚Ä¢	Sends logs to:
o	The console (transports.Console())
o	A file named combined.log (transports.File())
 Export
This makes the logger reusable throughout your project.
 Optional Improvements
If you want to make the logger more robust:
1.	Add log levels
2.	Add error stack tracking
3.	Separate error logs
 Code Breakdown
1. Imports and Variables
let channel, connection;
‚Ä¢	amqplib ‚Äî the standard Node.js client library for RabbitMQ.
‚Ä¢	connection ‚Äî holds the connection to the RabbitMQ server.
‚Ä¢	channel ‚Äî represents a communication channel within the connection.
Think of the connection as a phone line, and channels as individual conversations happening on that line.
2. Connecting to the Queue
async function connectQueue() {
    try {
        connection = await amqplib.connect("amqp://localhost");
        channel = await connection.createChannel();
        await channel.assertQueue("notf-queue");
What happens here:
‚Ä¢	Connects to a RabbitMQ broker running locally (amqp://localhost).
‚Ä¢	Creates a communication channel.
‚Ä¢	Ensures that a queue named "notf-queue" exists (creates it if not).
 If successful, your app is ready to send or receive messages through that queue.
4.	Sending Data to the Queue
        await channel.sendToQueue("notf-queue", Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(data)));
What happens here:
‚Ä¢	Converts your JavaScript object (data) into a Buffer (required by RabbitMQ).
‚Ä¢	Sends that data to the queue named "notf-queue".
4. Exporting Functions
This allows other files to use the queue setup:
 Works Well For:
‚Ä¢	Local testing
‚Ä¢	Small projects or single-instance apps
‚Ä¢	Sending notifications, logs, or events asynchronously
 Recommended Improvements for Production
If you plan to scale or use this in a backend service, here‚Äôs how you can make it stronger:
1.	Reconnect automatically if RabbitMQ restarts
2.	Acknowledge messages (if consuming)
If you add a consumer later, make sure to acknowledge (channel.ack(msg)) messages once processed.
3.	Environment variable for connection URL
4.	Durable queue for persistence
 Example Use Case
You could integrate this with your logger and server 
 How It Works
1.	require('dotenv') ‚Äî imports the dotenv library.
2.	dotenv.config() ‚Äî loads variables from a .env file into process.env.
3.	module.exports = { ... } ‚Äî exports the environment variables for other modules to use.
 Example .env File
You‚Äôll typically have a .env file in your project root like this:
PORT=4000
FLIGHT_SERVICE=https://api.example.com/flights
This file is not committed to GitHub (it‚Äôs added to .gitignore) because it can contain sensitive data like API keys or credentials.
Usage Example
In another file (say server.js or index.js), you can import it like:
const { PORT, FLIGHT_SERVICE } = require('./server-config');
üí° Optional Improvement
You can add default values to prevent crashes when environment variables are missing:
 Overview
This file defines two controller functions:
‚Ä¢	createBooking() ‚Üí creates a booking record.
‚Ä¢	makePayment() ‚Üí processes a payment safely using idempotency (so the same request isn‚Äôt processed twice).
Both functions use:
‚Ä¢	BookingService ‚Üí the business logic layer.
‚Ä¢	SuccessResponse / ErrorResponse ‚Üí standardized response objects.
‚Ä¢	StatusCodes ‚Üí from the http-status-codes package for clean, readable HTTP status values.
 Detailed Breakdown
1. Imports
‚Ä¢	StatusCodes: gives readable constants like StatusCodes.OK instead of hardcoding 200.
‚Ä¢	BookingService: encapsulates business logic (like DB operations or flight validation).
‚Ä¢	SuccessResponse and ErrorResponse: custom response wrappers (probably with { success, data, message, error } structure).
2. In-Memory Storage for Idempotency
This temporary object stores processed idempotency keys to prevent double payment execution.
 Example:
If the same payment request is retried with the same header key, it won‚Äôt be processed twice.
 Flow:
1.	Extracts flight, user, and seat details from the request.
2.	Passes them to the service layer.
3.	Sends a 200 OK success response.
4.	Catches and returns an error if something goes wrong.
 Best Practice Tip:
Instead of mutating a shared SuccessResponse object, you should clone it per request:
return res.status(StatusCodes.OK).json({
    ...SuccessResponse,
    data: response
});
This avoids potential concurrency issues when multiple requests modify the same object.
Flow:
1.	Checks for a header x-idempotency-key ‚Äî ensures unique payment requests.
2.	If key exists in memory, rejects with an error (prevents duplicate payments).
3.	If not, processes the payment via BookingService.makePayment().
4.	Caches the key in memory once successful.
5.	Returns a successful response.
 In production, instead of using an in-memory object (inMemDb), use a persistent store like Redis or a database to survive restarts or multi-instance scaling.
5. Exports
Allows this controller to be imported in a route file like:
 Summary of Good Practices
‚úî Uses async/await for clarity
‚úî Structured error handling
‚úî Clean HTTP status codes
‚úî Separation of concerns (controller vs. service)
‚úî Implements idempotency for safe payments
 Recommended Improvements
1.	Clone SuccessResponse/ErrorResponse instead of reusing shared objects.
2.	Replace inMemDb with a distributed cache (Redis) for scalability.
3.	Add detailed error messages or custom error classes in BookingService.
4.	Use a logger (winston or your logger-config) instead of console.log.
 What it Does
‚Ä¢	Purpose:
This file aggregates multiple controllers into one export point.
Instead of importing each controller individually, other parts of your app (like route files) can import them all from a single place.
‚Ä¢	InfoController ‚Üí likely handles basic API info routes (e.g., health checks, version info, etc.)
‚Ä¢	BookingController ‚Üí handles booking logic such as createBooking and makePayment (like the one you shared earlier).
 Example Project Structure
 Advantages:
‚Ä¢	Keeps imports neat and short.
‚Ä¢	Makes scaling easy (just add new controllers and export them here).
‚Ä¢	Improves readability and maintainability.
 Best Practice Tip
If your app grows larger, you can apply the same structure to other folders:
‚Ä¢	/services/index.js
‚Ä¢	/utils/index.js
‚Ä¢	/config/index.js
This pattern makes your project modular and production-grade.
 Code Review
 Explanation
1. Import:
‚Ä¢	The http-status-codes package provides readable constants like StatusCodes.OK instead of using magic numbers like 200.
2. The Controller Function:
‚Ä¢	Purpose: To confirm the API is running (useful for testing uptime or deployment).
‚Ä¢	console.log("hi"): for debugging (you can remove or replace with a logger).
‚Ä¢	Response format: Standardized JSON with:
o	success: Boolean ‚Äî indicates the API responded correctly.
o	message: Short description ("API is live").
o	error: Empty object placeholder ‚Äî good structure for consistency.
o	data: Empty object placeholder ‚Äî allows future expansion.
3. Export:
Allows you to import this function easily:
const { info } = require('../controllers/info-controller');
 Optional Enhancements
1.	Add timestamp or version info:
2.	return res.status(StatusCodes.OK).json({
3.	    success: true,
4.	    message: 'API is live',
5.	    version: '1.0.0',
6.	    timestamp: new Date(),
7.	});
8.	Use your logger instead of console.log:
9.	const logger = require('../config/logger-config');
10.	logger.info('Health check endpoint hit');
 Explanation
In Node.js, every file is a separate module.
When you write:
module.exports = { }
You‚Äôre defining what should be available to other files when they do:
const something = require('./this-file');
Since the object is empty {}, importing it gives you an empty object:
const something = require('./this-file');
console.log(something); // {}
üõ†Ô∏è Typical Use Cases
1.	Placeholder File (Scaffold)
You might have created it as a placeholder ‚Äî for example, in /controllers/index.js or /services/index.js ‚Äî where you‚Äôll later export functions or modules.
2.	Temporary Stub During Development
Maybe you‚Äôre setting up your folder structure before filling in actual logic later.
‚úÖ Example (After Adding Content)
Here‚Äôs how it will look once you add actual exports:
const { createUser, deleteUser } = require('./user-service');
const { sendEmail } = require('./notification-service');

module.exports = {
    createUser,
    deleteUser,
    sendEmail
}
